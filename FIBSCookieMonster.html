<h1>FIBS Cookie Monster</h1>

<p>
FIBS Cookie Monster (FCM) is a simple API (application programming
interface) to assign numeric keys--cookies--to messages sent by the FIBS
server. It identifies more than 200 distinct messages, as explained in
this documentation and the source code.

<a href="http://www.fibs.com/fcm/fcm.tar">FIBS Cookie Monster Source and
Documentation</a> Version 1.0 released 1 January 2003, tar format, 50K
bytes.
</p>

<h2>System Notes</h2>

<p>
FCM was developed and tested (I use the word "tested" very loosely) on
Mac OS X 10.2.3, using Apple's most current gcc based development tools
(Dec 2002 release). The code should work on other platforms, including
nearly all flavors of Linux, Unix, or Windows.  Although FCM is derived
from the MacFIBS source code, it is significantly different internally,
and may not work under Mac OS 9 (I have not tried it.)
</p>

<p>
FCM requires the regcomp/regexec/regfree functions to compile and
execute extended regular expressions. These functions typically are part
of the Standard C Library, refer to your compiler documentation or man
pages for more info.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h2>Programming Notes</h2>
<p>
The remainder of this page provides a brief overview of FCM's design and
use. It also includes several miscellaneous notes, presented in no
particular order.
</p>

<h3>FIBS Messages</h3>
<p>
A FIBS message is one line of ASCII text (when using FCM, the message
should not include the CR-LF terminator). FIBS messages are the basic
building block of communications with the FIBS server.
</p>

<p>
FIBS Cookie Monster's purpose is to identify FIBS messages. Some
messages are identified by specific text patterns (for example "It's
your turn to roll or double"), while other messages are identified by
where they occur during a FIBS session (the Message of the Day messages
sent after logging in). Using FCM, client software can process only the
messages it is interested in, ignoring the rest.
</p>

<p>
FCM performs no lexical or syntactic analysis on the contents of FIBS
messages. Some messages contain complex data, for example a "board:..."
message contains more than 20 numbers containg info about the game
state. Other messages, such as errors, contain just text strings. You
are responsible for parsing and interpreting message contents, based on
the requirements of your application.
</p>

<p>
FCM assumes your client uses <b>CLIP</b>, the <b>CLI</b>ent
<b>P</b>rotocol, to communicate with FIBS. Information about CLIP can be
found at <a href="http://www.fibs.demon.co.uk/">Andreas Schneider's home
page</a>.  Note that FCM uses a slightly modified version of clip.h,
which is included.
</p>

<h3>int FIBSCookie(char *);</h3>

<p>
<code>FIBSCookie()</code> is the principle function you will use. For
each message, call <code>FIBSCookie(theMessage);</code> to obtain a
cookie, which can be used to route the message to the appropriate parts
of your application, using whatever notification mechanism you choose
(such as a Publish/Subscribe design pattern.)
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> You must call <code>FIBSCookie()</code> with every message
received from the FIBS server, starting immediately after estabilishing
a TCP/IP connection with the server.  You cannot selectively call
FIBSCookie with some messages, but not others, because the underlying
state model may get confused.
</p>

<p>
If you disconnect and reconnect to the FIBS server, you should call
<code>ResetFIBSCookieMonster();</code> before reconnecting to reset the
state properly.
</p>

<h3>Malformed Messages</h3>

<p>
Clients of FCM may need to handle two special cases, where FIBS messages
are not properly separated by line terminator characters. If
<code>FIBSCookie(msg);</code> returns <code>FIBS_BAD_Board</code> or
<code>FIBS_BAD_AcceptDouble</code>, it means <code>msg</code> is
malformed. You must split the message into two separate messages and
process them separately.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure the cause of or the current status of this problem. While
getting FCM ready I was not able to confirm that these malformed
messages still occur, so I recommend that you test to see if you are
receiving these in your application.
</p>

<p>
The following code example shows one possible way to handle malformed
messages (note that this code has not been tested.)
</p>

<pre>
using namespace std;

void ProcessFIBSMessage(string&amp; msg)
{
	int cookie = FIBSCookie(msg.c_str());
	switch (cookie)
	{
	case FIBS_BAD_Board:
	{	// find end of the board:... message
		string tokens("0123456789:-\r");

		int i = msg.find(":0:");
		assert(i &gt; 0);

		int j = msg.find_first_not_of(tokens, i);
		assert(j &gt; 0);

		while (msg[--j] != ':')
			;
		j += 2;
		
		string firstMsg(msg.substr(0, j-1));
		ProcessFIBSMessage(firstMsg);
		
		string secondMsg(msg.substr(j));
		ProcessFIBSMessage(secondMsg);
		return;
	}
	break;

	case FIBS_BAD_AcceptDouble:
	{
		string tokens("0123456789.");

		int i = msg.find("cube shows ");
		assert(i &gt; 0)
		
		i += 11;	// after the find string
		
		int j = msg.find_first_not_of(tokens, i);
		assert(j &gt; 0);

		string firstMsg(msg.substr(0, j-1));
		ProcessFIBSMessage(firstMsg);
		
		string secondMsg(msg.substr(j));
		ProcessFIBSMessage(secondMsg);
		return;
	}
	break;
	
	default:
		// process cookie and msg normally
	}
}
</pre>

<h3>Telnet? We don't need no stinking Telnet!</h3>

<p>
When you are using CLIP, FIBS does not send any telnet negotiation
messages (after login, the server does send several telnet negotiation
requests to non-CLIP clients.)  Hence, you don't need to scan for telnet
bytes in incoming FIBS messages, which makes things easier.
</p>


<p>Enjoy!</p>
